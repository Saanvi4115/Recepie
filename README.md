Grab a griddle or large nonstick skillet.

Preheat and lightly grease your pan.

Use a simple ratio to make batter::
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 cup melted butter
1 egg
1 1/2 cups milk

Don't overbeat the batter.

Cook each pancake until bubbles form on top.

Add toppings before you flip.

Flip and let cook for another minute.
